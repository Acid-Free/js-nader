- Create a CLI (Command Line App) to download Pokemon info

- Use the Pokemon API (pokeapi.co) to fetch stats and pictures

- The user can choose to download any combination of:
    1. Stats (as a text file)
    2. Sprites (Up to 8 of the 2d sprite pictures for that pokemon)
    3. Artwork (The official artwork for that pokemon)

- A new folder should be created with the pokemon's name
- Stats should be saved in stats.text
    (save all the main stats and their values)
- Sprites should use the <sprite_name>.png and all 4-8 will be downloaded at once (Eg: front_default.png)
- The pokemon's artwork should be saved as original-artwork.png
- User should be asked if they want to search another pokemon
